# stepmatrix
Let Gr(k; n): Grassmannian variety of k-linear subspaces on n dimensional projective space P^n together with the Pl√ºcker embedding.

Let 1=f_1 f_2 f_3 ... f_d be list of strictly increasing integers starting from 1 where d = (k+1)x(n-k).

This Python script generates step matrices out of the sequence 1=f_1 f_2 f_3 ... f_d if it exists.

In fact, the existence of a step matrix ouf of the sequence 1=f_1 f_2 f_3 ... f_d is equievalent to existence of irreducible supernatural vector bundle on Gr(k; n) with the root sequence 1=f_1 f_2 f_3 ... f_d.
